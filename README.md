If you want to do some data analysis, the first question is, do you have data?

Absolutely YES.

Because you could scrape data from the internet.

Scraping data is not difficult as you think, just do it, you will find the path.

My srape scripts:

**[Scraping Amazon best seller data](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yishi/my_python_code/blob/master/Scraping%20Data%20in%20Python.ipynb)** on June 8 2016.

**[Scraping Lianjia house deal data](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yishi/my_python_code/blob/master/scraping_from_lianjia.ipynb)** on Feb 8 2017.
